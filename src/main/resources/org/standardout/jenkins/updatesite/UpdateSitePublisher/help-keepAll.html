    If you check this option, Jenkins will retain Update Sites for each successful build.
    This allows you to access Update Sites for older builds, at the expense of additional
    disk space requirement.

    <p>
    If you leave this option unchecked, Jenkins will only keep the latest Update Site,
    so older Update Sites will be overwritten as new builds succeed.
